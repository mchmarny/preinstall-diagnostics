# Run:AI Preinstall Diagnostics Tool

## Diagnostics tool for Run:AI installations
This tool is used prior to Run:AI installations to collect cluster information to
help fine-tune the installation process

## Build
```
REGISTRY=gcr.io/run-ai-lab VERSION=<your-private-tag> make -e all
```

## Running at client environments
- The binary should be provided to the customer according to their PC's platform (windows/linux/apple x86/ apple m1), the server platform is assumed to be `x86_64`
- The container image should be provided to the customer as well:
    * If the client environment is air-gapped, the image should be provided to them offline and pushed to their internal registry, and the binary should be run with `--image` to modify the image used.
    * If the client is connected to the internet, the proper image will be pulled from the `run-ai-prod` registry.
